Personal Note on My Ionic Project
Hello, and thank you for taking the time to review my project!

I had prior experience with Angular, so I wanted to focus on learning something new instead of revisiting concepts I already knew. That's why I decided to build this application using Ionic, a framework I recently started working with. This is my first project with Ionic, and I aimed to write modern, clean, and optimized code while reinforcing my Angular knowledge at the same time.

About the Project
This is a clothing application where products are fetched from AI-generated data. The images are not fully appropriate, as I couldn’t generate clothing-specific visuals. I have built a detailed product page where data is accessed through a service using Observables.

For authentication, I implemented registration & login functionality that integrates with Firebase. The login system works based on the user's email key connection, and I use encryption to store it securely in localStorage as a token.

Additionally, the application includes an error page and validation errors in forms to enhance the user experience.


Future Plans
I plan to add:
A "Save to Cart" feature
Profile settings
However, at the moment, I am working as an Angular developer and managing a heavy workload. My primary focus is on making my other project responsive before the 28th deadline—which takes some time away from this Ionic project.

Other Work
If you're interested, you can check out my other project, which I built entirely by myself:
 Website: FindHouse.ge
 GitHub: FindYourHouse Repository

Though it is modular and not a standalone project.

Final Thoughts
Again, thank you for your time and attention. If you have any suggestions or feedback, I would truly appreciate it!
